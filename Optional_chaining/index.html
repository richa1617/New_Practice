     <h1>Optional Chaining</h1>
    <p>The Optional Chaining operator  ?.  is used to check if variable immediately preceding the operator exists or not. By 'exists' we mean the nullish concept and not the truthy/false concept. A value is nullish only if it is either null or undefined. If the variable preceding the operator is nullish, then the execution of the statement will immediately return with the value of undefined. Else, the execution will proceed as normal.
